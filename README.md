# LangChain Overview

**LangChain** is an open-source framework designed to help developers build powerful applications using large language models (LLMs) like OpenAI's GPT, Anthropic's Claude, and others. It provides tools and abstractions that make it easy to connect LLMs with external data sources, APIs, and memory systems. This enables the creation of more dynamic, context-aware, and interactive applications.

## âœ¨ Key Features

- Easy integration with popular LLMs (GPT, Claude, etc.)
- Connects models with APIs, databases, and external tools
- Supports memory for contextual conversations
- Modular and extensible components

## ðŸš€ Common Use Cases

- Conversational Chatbots  
- Document Question Answering Systems  
- Code Assistants  
- AI Agents with Reasoning Capabilities  
- Customizable Tool-Using Agents
